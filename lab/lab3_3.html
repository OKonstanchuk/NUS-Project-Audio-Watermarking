Actually there’s another way to do this. When I was editing Samy’s email, I found that I could edit my email in the format of HTML. WOW, that could save a lot of time! Honestly, I even don’t need to re-write the attacker’s website, I could just embed my HTML attacking code in this email. Once Alice check this email, she will be attacked and send a friend request to Samy. 
It is even unnecessary for her to click any link. All Samy need is that Alice checks her email normally, and then, she gets attacked! My newly designed email is as follows.
