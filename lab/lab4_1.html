<p><b>What is the purpose of the extra information in the (CA) certificate you created? </b></p>
I don't know what means of the extra information,after I search the internet for extra information.And I found this answer :
<br>A digital certificate usually contains:</br>
<br>public key;</br>
<br>holder information;</br>
<br>Information about the Certificate Authority (CA);</br>
<br>The CA's digital signature of this document and the algorithm used;</br>
<br>certificate validity period;</br>
<br>the extra information;</br>
<br>According to the above information and the testCA.crt,I think the extra information are fingerprints in testCA.crt.And it is used to authenticate the identity and determine whether the document has been tampered with</br>

<p><b>Explain the files you created. What is each file used for?</b></p>
<br>In the experiment, we mainly do two things:</br>
<br>1.Use openssl to create a root certificate</br>
<br>2.create the certificate for the server</br>

<br>On step 1:</br>
<br>localhost.cnf:Store some configuration files for simplifying parameters</br>
<br>testCA.key:private key file</br>
<br>testCA.crt:Credential crt file</br>

<br>On step 2:</br>
<br>localhost.key:key for the server</br>
<br>localhost.csr:certificate signing request csr file for the client key</br>
<br>localhost.crt:Use the key of the CA certificate to sign the client key and generate a signature file</br>
<br>testCA.srl:Record the serial number of the certificate generated by the current CA</br>

<p><b>Why is the webserver using both the certificate and private key? (What does it use each for?)</b></p>
<br>In most protocols, client and server indicate that both parties want to establish an encrypted session.</br>
<br>1. The server transmits the digital certificate to the client. The certificate contains the public key of the server. The client uses the public key to parse the digital signature in the certificate, which can verify the identity of the server.</br>
<br>2. The client generates a symmetric encryption key for encrypted transmission of actual data, encrypts it with the server's public key, and transmits the generated key to the server. Also carry a "client finished" encrypted with the encryption key just generated.</br>
<br>3. The server receives the symmetric encryption key and tries to decrypt the encrypted field with the key. If the plaintext "client finished" can be obtained, the key is considered valid and can be used for subsequent data encryption transmission. At the same time, "server finished" is encrypted with this key and passed to the client.</br>
<br>4. The client decrypts with the symmetric secret key. If the plaintext "server finished" can be obtained, the client believes that the server has correctly received the symmetric key.</br>
<br>Using both certificates and private keys at the same time can greatly improve security and prevent data from being decrypted during transmission</br>
<br>The specific running example is as follows:</br>
