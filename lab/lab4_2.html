<p1><b>Task 1: Getting Familiar with Shellcode</b></p1>
<br>typing make in terminal,then Two binaries will be created, a32.out (32-bit) and a64.out (64-bit).Run them and we observe that we get the root shell.</br>

<br><p1><b>Task 2:Understanding the Vulnerable Program</b></p1></br>
<br>Since the  compilation and setup commands are already included in Makefile,we just need to type make to execute those commands.</br>

<p1><b>Task 3:Launching Attack on 32-bit Program </b><p1>
<br>Our purpose is to implement malicious code by exploiting buffer overflows and eventually gain root privileges.</br>
<br>We can see that in the exploit.py file, we need to fill in several parts, namely shellcode, start, ret and offset.</br>
<br>First, we fill in the 32-bit corresponding malicious code to obtain root shell.</br>

<br>Then we analyze the stack frame structure in the function bof:</br>

<br>We consider putting shellcode at the end of badfile, so "start = 517-len(shellcode)"</br>
<br>After that we need to determine the position of ret in badfile, that is offset. We consider offset = ebp - &buffer + 4 , so the first step is to determine the values of ebp and &buffer.</br>
<br>We print out the ebp value and the bufferâ€™s address through the gdb debugging tool.</br>

<br>According to the note1 in the task book,we need to use next to execute a few instructions and stop after the ebp register is modified to point to the stack frame of the bof() function.</br>

<br>buff = 0xffffca7c</br>
<br>ebp = 0xffffcae8</br>

<br>The value of ret (return address) should jump after new ret and before shellcode. This ensures that the shellcode is executed.</br>
<br>so ret = ebp + n(n>=8)</br>
<br>But I found that when n=8, the program reported an error:segmentation fault.</br>
<br>According to the note2 in the task book,the real stack frame value is larger than the value of the gdb runtime,so we should add an offset.</br>
<br>After many attempts, I found that offsets between 200-300 can get a root shell.</br>
<br>Now let's check it!</br>

<br>OK!I obtain the root shell!</br>
