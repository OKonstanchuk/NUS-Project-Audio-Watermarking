<p1><b>Task 1:Finding out the Addresses of libc Functions</b></p1>
<br>We used the p command to print the addresses of system() and exit() functions.</br>
<br>As follow:</br>

<br><p1><b>Task 2: Putting the shell string in the memory</b></p1></br>
I uesd the method inntask 2 to put the shell string in the memory.
First define a new shell variable MYSHELL = /bin/sh,then I will use the addresses of this variable as an argument to system() call.
Following the code in task3.2, we could compile the code and print the addresses of MYSHELL.

<p1><b>Task 3: Launching the Attack </b></p1>
According to the above two tasks,we get thses informations:
0xf7e12420 <system>
0xf7e04f80 <exit>
0xffffd3f6 bin/sh
So it is natural to fill them in the corresponding address.
After we should consider the stack frame structure to figure out X,Y and Z.
I think the stack frame as this:
<br><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73998546/180268579-bb65767b-38ef-46f6-a582-a8ae28ab4e1e.jpg"></br>
Since we are going to excute the function system(),the return address should be loaded the system_addr.
So Y should be the relative offset of ret,Y = ebp - buff + 4.
And then, considering the addresses of the variable MYSHELL as an argument to system() call,I put it behind the system().
So X = ebp - buff + 8
Then execute function exit(),I put it behind MYSHELL.
So Z = ebp - buff + 12
Let's try to run
<br><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73998546/180268633-efae3337-cbbf-4afa-a968-71db83adbc03.png"></br>

Opps maybe something wrong.We check it.I think the system_addr won't be wrong,that's the start of the execution programm.
So maybe X or Z is wrong.At present I have no idea,so we could try to change X and Z.
I first tried swapping the values of X and Z, after that I ran the program.Then it works!

It's amazing,I wonder how.After I search on Internet about the stack frame structure,then I find this:
<br><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73998546/180268707-6095327f-d6bf-409c-a99f-add9f052684a.png"></br>
So the position "ebp - buff + 8" to be filled in is the return address of the system.
The return address of system is followed by the parameters,and MYSHELL is passed as a parameter to system.

<p1><b>Attack variation 1: Is the exit() function really necessary?</b></p1>
<br>I think it's not really necessary.
Actually, I found that whether it is to remove the exit, or to change the position of the exit, such as making Z = ebp - buff + 4 or Z = ebp - buff + 16,
can successfully obtain root privileges. 
My idea is that the main function of this experiment is to pass MYSHELL as a parameter and run the system function at the same time. 
This has little to do with exit. As long as the previous steps are successfully executed, root privileges can be obtained.
Even if I remove exit, it still gets root shell and exits successfully, this is what I have observed.
According to the paper,the function exit() seems to help the shellcode to quit without a trace,but I could not find somewhere different with the previous.</br>

<p1><b>Attack variation 2: change the file name of retlib to a different name,Repeat the attack (without changing the content of badfile). Will your attack succeed or not?</b></p1>
<br>After rename the file name , my attack failed.
In fact, when the program is executed, the name of the program is passed on the stack first,
 and then the other variables in the program are passed on the stack. So when we only change the length of the program name, 
 the addresses of the other environment variables will be extended backwards,and our badfile isn't changeg, which will cause us to be unable to access the correct environment variables
 , so the attack fails.</br>
